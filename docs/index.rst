KITTY Imports Tiled Tilemaps Yay!
=================================

This is a Tiled importer for Unity.

KITTY differentiates itself from other Tiled importers through seamless basic integration, automatic
object-to-prefab instantiation, and friction-free translation from Tiled custom properties to C#
fields.

KITTY imports every graphic, object and setting you've defined in your Tiled tilemaps into Unity.

Unity's built-in tilemap editor is okay, but Tiled is way better. You can define stuff like text,
warps, and pickups directly in Tiled. KITTY just imports and applies all that seamlessly.
